Application starts at: `http://localhost:3080`

### Project Structure

## **The Challenge**

Create a person profile page in React to display the personnel record in the ``/fixtures/personnel.json`` file.

A basic component file has been created in ``/components/content/Personnel.jsx`` that displays the first name and last name as a starting point to show how to access the data, please feel free to modify the code in any way and create as many other components as you require. You are welcome to add any packages that you feel are appropriate and useful for completing the task.

It is up to you how much of the data you want to display and how you want to display it - this is an opportunity to show off your front-end design skills.

**Note**: We are looking for good aesthetics and clean design. Responsiveness across varying devices and resolutions is a strong bonus!

## **Delivery**

Please fork this project and submit a pull request to the master branch once completed.
